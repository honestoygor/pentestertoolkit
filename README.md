# PythonExploit
These are some simple exploits that runs in Python.

## MAC Changer
A MAC address changer, also known as a MAC address spoofing tool, is a software or hardware tool that allows users to modify or forge the MAC address of a network interface making the device apear with a different identifier. This is done ir order to enchance privacy, security, or bypassing certain network restrictions. This action makes it more challenging for network administrators to track the real identities of certain devices.
* Below is a diagram showing how the MAC Changer works:

* Usage information:
```
mac_changer.py --help
```
* Change MAC address for eth0 to a specific address:
```
mac_changer.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

## ARP Spoofing
* You need to enable IPv4 fowarding so the target still have internet connection as you foward their requests to the router.
  * Enter root mode:
```
sudo su
```
  * Enable IPv4 Fowarding:
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
