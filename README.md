## [↑](#-table-of-contents) MAC Changer
A MAC address changer, also known as a MAC address spoofing tool, is a software or hardware tool that allows users to modify or forge the MAC address of a network interface making the device apear with a different identifier. This is done ir order to enchance privacy, security, or bypassing certain network restrictions. This action makes it more challenging for network administrators to track the real identities of certain devices.
* Below is a diagram showing how the MAC Changer works:

Usage information:
* Request info:
```
mac_changer.py --help
```
* Change MAC address for eth0 to a specific address:
```
mac_changer.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

## [↑](#-table-of-contents) Network Scanner
A network scanner is a tool or software application designed to discover and gather information about devices within a computer network.
* Below is a diagram showing how the Network Scanner works:

</p>

Usage information:
* Request info:
```
network_scanner.py --help
```
* Perform an ARP scan on a specific IP range:
  * This command will scan the IP range 10.10.1.1 to 10.10.1.254.
```
network_scanner.py -t 10.10.1.1/24
```
* Scan a single IP address:
```
network_scanner.py -t 10.10.1.1
```


## [↑](#-table-of-contents) ARP Spoofing
ARP (Address Resolutions Protocol) spoofing, also called ARP poisoning, sends false ARP replies to the target device or to the entire network as theses fake replies associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of the target device. This technique is usually used for man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Below is a diagram showing how the ARP Spoofer works:

Since this is not a one way ARP spoofing you need to enable IPv4 fowarding so the target still have internet connection as you foward their traffic to the router.
* Enter root mode:
```
sudo su
```
* Enable IPv4 Fowarding:
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
Usage information:
* Request info:
```
arp_spoof.py --help
```
* Change MAC address for eth0 to a specific address:
```
arp_spoof.py -t 10.10.1.101 -g 10.10.1.2
```
Once the tool is interrupted it will execute commands to restore the ARP tables giving the correct information back to the target and router which will display ```[+] ARP tables restored``` once is has finished the process.

## [↑](#-table-of-contents) Packet Sniffing
A packet sniffer, also known as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer, main purpose is to inspect and interpret the data packets that flow through a computer network. This packet sniffing tool will search highlight for login credentials used by the target during a man-in-the-middle attack.
* Below is a diagram showing how the Packet Sniffing works:

Usage information:
* Request info:
```
packet_sniffer.py --help
```
* Perform a sniff between a interface and localhost:
```
packet_sniffer.py -i eth0
```
